So that was an interesting looking.

4:51 - Thales Miletus
So thanks again for taking the time to do this. So I read through some of the links you sent me. Obviously, I looked at your LinkedIn profile. Earlier today, I was reading the CleverTap. I think it was a blog or article you wrote on CleverTap about usage and retention and measuring that, right? So the way we could, I thought we could do this, and again, you know, this is, the outline is just for us to have some kind of a structure. We don't have to live by it, but I would just do an introduction.

5:35 - Thales Miletus
And by the way, this is audio only. The video is more for us to interact, but when we post it, it'll be audio only. But what we've started to do now is, Like when you have something very insightful to say, think of it as a soundbite. Then what we do is we take that and put it with some video captions or something. I'll be sharing all of that with you via email before we publish, so you can review it. But yeah, basically I'll just introduce you, talk about your career timeline based on what's there on LinkedIn........
