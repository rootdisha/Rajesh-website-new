      excerpt: "Buried in Postman’s recent massive Series D investment round [USD225M] announcement was a quaint reference by their founder Abhinav Asthana to the “Postman flywheel”. Here he laid down their journey starting with how internal development teams initially used the Postman API platform to build, test and manage their APIs and collaborate with other internal teams which then had a significant compounding effect. Eventually, this morphed into public API networks [if customer chose to use it]. Postman also offers demo accounts for customers to access and try APIs in a sandbox environment. By creating both public and private API networks and becoming a go-to destination developers globally, Postman effectively managed to achieve the revered “flywheel effect” and catapulted to Unicorn status."

You have just wrapped up a brainstorming session with the team and are convinced that you have identified the next “cool” product idea or feature(s) and can’t wait to get it out the door. Before you decide to cross the chasm and hit COMMIT on your roadmap a) PAUSE and take a deep breath b) ponder about the new product idea checklist-- WAIT. What checklist you say ?
